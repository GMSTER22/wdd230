        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>

          Bountiful Foods has a physical presence like their storefront and food trucks, but what they're missing is an online presence to get the attention of potential customers living in California that are not aware of their presence and also keep reminded their customers of their presence. The purpose is to establish an online presence showing potential customers what they have to offer: fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order fruit drinks and fruit bags.
