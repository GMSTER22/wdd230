        <h2 class="title">Alignment</h2>

        <div class="content">

          <div class="website">

            <h3 class="website-name">Apple</h3>

            <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a>

          </div>

          <img class="website-image" src="./images/applecom.png" alt="">

          <p class="text">

            The Apple website uses the alignment design principle as we can see with the way images and text are aligned on their website. The text and images are centered aligned which on a small device I would say mimic perfectly the way user would scroll their page with their eyes perfectly fixed on the middle of the page. Using this principle helped make the page really clean, appealing and offering good readability.

        <h2 class="title">Visual Hierarchy</h2>

        <div class="content">

          <div class="website">

            <h3 class="website-name">Calendly</h3>

            <a href="https://calendly.com/">calendly.com</a>

          </div>

          <img class="website-image" src="./images/calendlycom.png" alt="">

          <p class="text">

            Calendly utilizes the principle of visual hierarchy to guide the user on where the important information is. When landing on their page it is hard for the user not to set his eyes on the title which tells a lot about what the company do in three words, the two call to action with the sign up button being more noticeable than the get started, not to forget the small paragraph and email input which a user would probably notice last. Calendly arranged the different component per order of importance using a descending logic meaning that the user would notice the title, then if he is curious would jump straight to the paragraph to learn a little bit more and will decide if he needs more information from there and the user who comes because he knows scheduling already wouldn't miss the sign up or get started button.

        <h2 class="title">Proximity</h2>

        <div class="content">

          <div class="website">

            <h3 class="website-name">Nike</h3>

            <a href="https://www.nike.com/">nike.com</a>

          </div>

          <img class="website-image" src="./images/nikecom.png" alt="">

          <p class="text">

            I would consider Nike being a great example of how to use proximity. The amount of white space between elements is used to create a sense of relationship or separation between them. It is easy to spot what elements goes together as they seem to be organized as sections, each with a title, an image, some text and sometimes a call to action. There is a clean cut between the sections and the spacing between elements that belongs to the same section is less than the space between different sections easily creating that visual feeling of proximity or separation.
